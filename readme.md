# Setup

`npm i`

# Run

`http-server <projectfolder>`

(or you can use any other local server)

# Change live stream source

If the game in the source is already over, pls change the source in `stream.js` line 2

Here's a stream that always works: [https://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/yp34SRmf.m3u8](https://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/yp34SRmf.m3u8)

# Video.js

There's also a video.js player in here to proof that the issue is actually only in jwplayer. The sporttotal.tv website however relies on jwplayer atm.
